For a while there has been a lot of confusion about different collaboration
options in O365. It offers multiple different tools (SharePoint Team Sites, 
Yammer, O365 Groups and Microsoft Teams), which seem to have a lot of 
overlapping functionalities. 

But Microsoft's plans for these different tools are finally taking shape and
the role of each tool is becoming more clear. To help out our customers, 
I wrote a small blog post about the subject in Affecto's Blog. 

So if you too feel a bit confused about the different collaboration options,
head on to [Affecto's blog](http://www.affecto.com/insights/blog/future-collaboration-office-365/)
and check which tool you should use and when.
